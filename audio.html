        All the life she has seen
All the meaner side of me
They took away the prophet's dream
For a profit on the street<br><br>
        
Now she's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow<br><br>
        
All his life he's been told
He'll be nothing when he's old
All the kicks and all the blows
He won't ever let it show<br><br>
        
'Cause he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow<br><br>
        
<span style="background-color:#368dbf;">When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour, turn the pain into power<br><br>
          
When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour, turn the pain into power<br><br></span>
        
All the hurt, all the lies
All the tears that they cry
When the moment is just right
You see fire in their eyes<br><br>
        
'Cause he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow<br><br>
        
<span style="background-color:#368dbf;">When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's how a superhero learns to fly

When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour, turn the pain into power
(Power, power, power, power, power)<br><br></span>
        
Every day, every hour turn the pain into power
(Power, power, power, power)<br><br>
        
Every day, every hour turn the pain into power<br><br>
        
She's got lions in her heart, a fire in her soul
He's a got a beast in his belly that's so hard to control
'Cause they've taken too much hits, taking blow by blow
Now light a match, stand back, watch 'em explode<br><br>

Oh, yes (power, power, power, power)
